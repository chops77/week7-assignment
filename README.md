# Project: What To Play

Love video games but having a hard time to decide what game to play next? The What To Play (WTP) App helps video game players to pick the best game to play by narrowing down the choices with criterias such as platform, genre, play time, popularity, and trending.
#### Features
- Various criterias and sorting options to help narrow down the choice.
- Personal `Bucket List` to save the games to play next.
- `Played` and `In Progress` list to track your game record.
- A `Pick One For Me button` for the most indecisive.
- Easy sign up using OAuth.
