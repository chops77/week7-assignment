# Project: What To Play

Love video games but having a hard time to decide what game to play next? The What To Play (WTP) App helps video game players to pick the best game to play by narrowing down the choices with criterias such as platform, genre, play time, popularity, and trending.
#### Features
- Various criterias and sorting options to help narrow down the choice.
- Personal bucket list to save the games to play next.
- Played and In Progress list to track your game record.
- A Pick One For Me button for the most indecisive.
- Easy sign up using OAuth.

## Wireframe

![What To Play](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chops77/week7-assignment/main/wireframe.png)

## Dependencies
- [api.rawg.io](https://api.rawg.io/docs/)
- [Fire base](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

* The name of your project
* An elevator pitch (a paragraph about what your project does). Be sure to address:
  * Who will use your project
  * The value that your project will provide to the end user
* [Wireframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) to help visualize what your project will look like
  * These wireframes do not have to be high-fidelity. You're free to use boxes, hand drawings, tools such as Draw.io, etc.
* A list of dependencies you'll be using for your project (npm modules, APIs, Firebase, etc.)
  * This list will likely change as you work on your project, but listing your dependencies will help you visualize the complexity of the project
* A list of tasks that need to be completed for your project
  * Example list of tasks for the Star Wars films example:
    * Setup `create-react-app` scaffold
    * Call the Star Wars API and print results
    * Store API results in React component state
    * Render React state
* A plan for the next 3 weeks and what you plan to accomplish each week

## Recommendations

* Keep the scope of your project small. A small, completed project is much better than a large, incomplete project. You can create a list of "nice to have" features that you can work on if you have time (similar to how our assignments have a main list of requirements and "bonus" items).
* Ensure you have plenty of buffer time in your schedule. Life events pop up, and tasks can take longer than initially estimated.
